# Expense Report

Scan email for receipts, categorize spending, send a monthly report.

## 1. Find Receipts

Using your **email skill**, search for receipt emails from the past month:
- Subject contains: receipt, order, payment, invoice, confirmation
- From common vendors (Amazon, Apple, Uber, etc.)
- Has attachments (PDF receipts)

## 2. Extract Amounts

For each receipt email, extract:
- **Amount** — Total charged
- **Vendor** — Who charged it
- **Date** — When the charge occurred
- **Category** — Auto-categorize (see below)

### Categories
- **Subscriptions** — Recurring charges (streaming, SaaS, memberships)
- **Food & Dining** — Restaurants, delivery, groceries
- **Shopping** — Amazon, retail purchases
- **Travel** — Flights, hotels, rideshare
- **Services** — Utilities, phone, internet
- **Other** — Everything else

## 3. Build Report

Format the expense report:

```markdown
# Expense Report — [Month YYYY]

## Summary
- **Total:** $X,XXX.XX
- **Transactions:** XX

## By Category
| Category | Amount | Count |
