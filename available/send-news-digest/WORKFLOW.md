- **Tech:** AI, startups, product launches
- **Crypto:** Bitcoin, Ethereum, DeFi, regulation
- **Business:** Markets, earnings, economy
- **Industry-specific:** Healthcare, fintech, climate

If unknown, ask the user or default to general tech/business.

## 3. Filter and Rank

**Include:**

## 4. Format the Digest
