# Focus Mode

Bright lights, no noise, no distractions — time to do deep work.

## 1. Optimize Lighting

Using your **smart lighting skill**:
- Set lights to full brightness
- Use cool/daylight color temperature (4000-5000K)
- Consistent lighting across workspace

Bright, cool light promotes alertness and focus.

## 2. Silence Audio

Using your **speaker skill**:
- Pause all playback
- Mute speakers

Or optionally play focus-friendly audio (white noise, lo-fi).

## 3. Block Distractions

Using your **system skill** or **browser skill**:
- Block distracting websites (social media, news, etc.)
- Enable Do Not Disturb on your device
- Silence non-essential notifications

### Common sites to block
- twitter.com, x.com
- reddit.com
- youtube.com
- instagram.com
- facebook.com
- news sites

## 4. Set a Timer (Optional)

Using your **timer skill** or system timer:
- Set a focus session (25-90 minutes)
- Remind when the session is over

## After Running

Report the setup:

```
🎯 Focus Mode Activated

✅ Lights: 100% brightness, daylight
✅ Audio: Muted
✅ Distractions: 6 sites blocked
✅ Do Not Disturb: Enabled
⏱️ Timer: 50 minutes

Time for deep work. You've got this!
```

## Deactivation

To end focus mode:
- "End focus mode"
- "Normal mode"
- Or wait for the timer

This will unblock sites and restore normal settings.

## Notes

- Ideal session length: 50-90 minutes
- Take breaks between sessions
- Pair with a physical cue (close the door, put on headphones)
