# Morning Quote

Start the day with inspiration. A carefully chosen quote delivered to your inbox.

## 1. Select a Quote

Choose a quote that fits the user's current context:

### Themes by Situation
- **Building something:** Quotes about shipping, iteration, starting before you're ready
- **Struggling:** Quotes about resilience, failure as learning, persistence
- **Big week ahead:** Quotes about focus, priorities, saying no
- **Feeling good:** Quotes about gratitude, momentum, paying it forward
- **Default:** Timeless wisdom — stoic philosophy, creativity, perseverance

### Quote Sources
Draw from classic philosophers (Marcus Aurelius, Seneca), modern thinkers (Naval Ravikant, Paul Graham), builders (Steve Jobs, Sahil Lavingia), and writers (Anne Lamott, Steven Pressfield).

## 2. Format the Message

```
☀️ Good morning!

"{Quote text}"
— {Author}

{Optional: One sentence connecting it to their day/goals}

Have a great {day of week}!
```

Keep it short. The quote should breathe.

## 3. Deliver

Using your **messaging skill**, send the quote to the user.

## Tracking

Track delivery to avoid duplicates:
- Only send if not already sent today
- Don't repeat recent quotes (keep last 30)

## Notes

- Schedule for early morning (6:30-7:00 AM)
- Deliver BEFORE the morning briefing — inspiration first, logistics second
- If the user gives feedback ("love this" or "meh"), learn their preferences
