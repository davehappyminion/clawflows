# Morning Mode

Bright warm lights, comfortable temperature, and energizing music to start the day.

## 1. Set Lighting

Using your **smart lighting skill**:
- Turn on lights to 70-80% brightness
- Use warm white color temperature (2700-3000K)
- Gradually brighten if possible (sunrise simulation)

Focus on:
- Bedroom
- Bathroom
- Kitchen

## 2. Adjust Thermostat

Using your **thermostat skill**:
- Set to comfortable morning temperature
- Heat: 68-70°F / 20-21°C
- Cool: 72-74°F / 22-23°C

Adjust based on season and user preference.

## 3. Play Morning Music

Using your **speaker skill**:
- Play an energizing morning playlist
- Set volume to moderate (not jarring)
- Kitchen or common area speakers

Upbeat but not aggressive — ease into the day.

## 4. Prepare Information (Optional)

If paired with send-morning-briefing:
- Queue up today's weather
- Preview calendar
- Surface important notifications

## After Running

Report the setup:

```
☀️ Morning Mode Activated

✅ Lights: 80%, warm white
✅ Thermostat: 69°F (heating)
✅ Music: Morning playlist on kitchen speaker
📅 Today: 3 meetings, first at 9:00 AM

Good morning! Time to start the day.
```

## Notes

- Schedule via automation for your usual wake time
- Adjust brightness/temperature based on season
- Can trigger send-morning-briefing automatically
- Weekend mode might use different settings (dimmer, later music)
