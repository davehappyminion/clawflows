# Night Mode

Wind down for the evening — dim warm lighting and relaxing atmosphere.

## 1. Dim Lighting

Using your **smart lighting skill**:
- Dim lights to 20-30% brightness
- Use very warm color temperature (2200-2700K, orange/red tones)
- Turn off overhead lights, use lamps instead
- Turn off bright switches entirely

Blue light suppresses melatonin — warm dim light helps prepare for sleep.

## 2. Adjust Thermostat

Using your **thermostat skill**:
- Lower temperature slightly for sleep
- 65-68°F / 18-20°C is optimal for sleep
- Or set to night/sleep schedule

## 3. Play Relaxing Audio

Using your **speaker skill**:
- Play a sleep/relaxation playlist
- Ambient sounds, lo-fi, classical, or nature sounds
- Low volume
- Set a sleep timer (30-60 minutes)

## 4. Reduce Stimulation

Using your **system skill** (if available):
- Enable night shift / blue light filter on devices
- Enable Do Not Disturb
- Dim device screens

## After Running

Report the setup:

```
🌙 Night Mode Activated

✅ Lights: 25%, warm orange
✅ Switches: Off
✅ Thermostat: 66°F
✅ Music: Sleep playlist (45 min timer)
✅ Blue light filter: Enabled

Time to wind down. Rest well!
```

## Notes

- Schedule 1-2 hours before target bedtime
- Precedes activate-sleep-mode (full darkness)
- Pairs with send-bedtime-reminder
- Creates a consistent wind-down routine
