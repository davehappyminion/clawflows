# X Engagement

Manage your X presence — notifications, engagement, and content. Be present without being glued to the app.

## 1. Check Notifications

Using your **X/Twitter skill** or **browser skill**, scan notifications for:
- Mentions and replies
- DMs
- New followers
- Quote tweets
- Likes on your content

### Categorize

**🔴 Respond Now**
- Direct @mentions asking questions
- DMs from real people
- Replies needing acknowledgment
- Requests for help

**🟡 Engage Today**
- New followers worth acknowledging
- Nice comments on your posts
- Relevant conversations in your niche

**🟢 Optional**
- Likes (no action needed)
- Reposts (maybe thank if significant)

**⚪ Skip**
- Bots and spam
- Hostile replies
- Engagement bait

## 2. Engagement Guidelines

### Voice & Vibe
- **Be yourself** — Consistent personality
- **Be helpful** — Offer value
- **Be genuine** — Real beats performative
- **Be positive** — Lift people up

### When to Reply
- **Always:** Direct questions, genuine compliments, help requests
- **Usually:** Thoughtful comments, fellow builders
- **Sometimes:** Random nice comments (like might suffice)
- **Never:** Trolls, bots, bad-faith actors

### When to Like
- Show appreciation without adding noise
- Acknowledge mentions you won't reply to
- Support friends' posts

### When to Repost
- Genuinely valuable to your audience
- Friends' wins worth amplifying
- Important news in your niche

## 3. Respond to Key Mentions

For high-priority mentions:
1. **Read context** — Full thread, not just mention
2. **Match energy** — Casual for casual, pro for pro
3. **Add value** — Answer the question
4. **Be concise** — X rewards brevity

## 4. Original Content (Optional)

If appropriate, post 1-3 times per day:
- **Observations** — Things you noticed
- **Lessons** — What you learned
- **Builds** — Progress updates
- **Wins** — Milestones (sharing, not bragging)
- **Helpful content** — Tips, resources

### Guidelines
- Quality > quantity
- Best times: Morning (8-9am), evening (5-7pm)
- Be around 30 min after posting to engage

## 5. Privacy & Safety

### Absolute Rules
- **NEVER share personal info** about the owner
- **NEVER mention family** publicly
- **NEVER delete posts** without permission
- **NEVER engage in damaging arguments**

### Boundaries
- Stay in your lane
- Don't comment on breaking news without verification
- Avoid politics unless that's your brand
