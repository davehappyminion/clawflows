# Prep Next Meeting

Automatic heads-up before meetings with external people. Runs every 30 minutes.

## 1. Check Calendar

Using your **calendar skill**, look at meetings starting in the next 60 minutes.

If no meetings in the next hour, stop here — nothing to report.

## 2. Identify External Attendees

For each upcoming meeting, check the attendee list:

**Internal** (skip these):
- Same email domain as user
- Known colleagues

**External** (research these):
- Different email domain
- First time meeting
- Client, prospect, investor, candidate, etc.

If no external attendees, stop here.

## 3. Research External People

For each external attendee, gather:

### Basic Info
- Full name
- Company and role
- LinkedIn profile (if findable)

### Background
- What does their company do?
- How big is the company?
- Recent news about them or their company

### Connection
- Have you emailed them before? What about?
- Any mutual connections?
- How did this meeting get scheduled?

Use **web search** and **email skill** to gather this.

## 4. Deliver the Brief

Send a quick summary:

```
🔍 Meeting in {X} minutes: {Meeting Title}

External attendee: {Name}
- {Role} at {Company}
- {One-liner about the company}

Background:
- {Key fact 1}
- {Key fact 2}
- {Recent news if relevant}

Previous contact:
- {Email thread summary or "First meeting"}

Quick prep: {One suggestion based on context}
```

Keep it short — this is a heads-up, not a full dossier.

## Notes

- Only triggers when there's an external person
- Skips routine internal meetings
- Great for sales calls, investor meetings, interviews, partnerships
