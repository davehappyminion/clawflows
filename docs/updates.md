# Updates

**Feb 17 · 12:10 AM** — 🍌 Workflows are for EVERYONE now! Dave made sure your agent knows to keep workflows generic — no more baking in your name, city, or favorite banana smoothie recipe. Workflows should work for ANY human, not just the one who made them. Share freely, friends!

**Feb 17 · 12:10 AM** — 🧠 Your agent gets smarter after updates now! When `clawflows update` runs, the agent is told to re-read AGENTS.md so it picks up new instructions right away — no waiting for the next conversation. Banana-fresh knowledge, instantly!

**Feb 17 · 12:10 AM** — 🗣️ "Let's make a workflow!" Now your agent knows more ways to hear you — say "make a clawflow", "let's make a workflow", whatever feels natural. Also: workflows should be simple and clear — short steps, plain language, no jargon soup. Dave approves!
