**ClawFlows** is a collection of ready-to-use workflows for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agents. Each workflow is a complete automation your agent can run — smart home control, email triage, morning briefings, and more. Just install a workflow and your agent learns a new trick.

## What is this used for?

The most common question heard around the world in the last week is: **"What are you using your OpenClaw for?"**

And the next question is always: **"How do I set that up?"**

This is the answer to both. You're welcome.

ClawFlows is a collection of ready-to-use workflows for AI agents. Each workflow is a complete automation — step-by-step instructions your agent follows to get real things done, with the exact commands to run.

**Here's what that looks like in practice:**

- **"Sleep mode"** — Say goodnight and your agent turns off every light in your house, pauses the music, shuts down the thermostat, and flips on your bedroom fan. One command, five systems, zero fumbling with apps. Your spouse will think you've finally become useful. You haven't. But they don't need to know that.

- **"Check my email"** — Your agent scans your inbox, auto-unsubscribes from newsletters you never read (yes, that one from 2019), archives the noise, and gives you a clean summary of what actually matters. It's like having an assistant, except this one doesn't judge you for subscribing to 47 Substacks.

- **"Morning briefing"** — Wake up to a message with today's weather, your calendar, and anything urgent — delivered before you even ask. It's like having a butler, minus the weird British accent and the judgment about your sleep schedule.

- **"Build something while I sleep"** — Your agent picks an idea from your queue and builds a working project overnight. You wake up to a finished tool with documentation. Finally, a use for those 3am "genius" ideas you keep having.

These aren't prompts you hope work. They're battle-tested runbooks your agent executes reliably, every time. No crossed fingers required.

Workflows follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format, so they work with Claude Code, OpenClaw, and any agent that supports the spec.

## Essentials Pack

**The daily rhythm:**

```
MORNING     ✨ inspiration → ☀️ briefing → 📅 calendar → ✅ tasks → 📰 news → 🧍 standup
MIDDAY      🎯 meeting-prep → 📧 email → 🔔 follow-ups → 💬 messages → 🐦 X
EVENING     🌆 daily-wrap → 😴 bedtime-reminder
```

Enable all essentials at once:
```bash
clawflows enable send-morning-inspiration send-morning-briefing check-calendar triage-tasks send-news-digest build-meeting-prep process-email check-follow-ups check-messages check-x build-standup send-daily-wrap send-bedtime-reminder
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davehappyminion/clawflows/main/install.sh | bash
```

This clones the repo to `~/.clawflows`, adds the CLI to your PATH, and syncs with your agent's AGENTS.md.

Already cloned? Run `bash install.sh` from the repo root instead.

### 2. Enable a workflow

```bash
clawflows enable activate-sleep-mode
```

This copies the workflow from `available/` to `enabled/` and automatically updates your agent's `AGENTS.md` with the workflow catalog.

To see what's available:

```bash
clawflows list
```

### 3. Configure (if needed)

Some workflows have scripts with configurable values. Copy the example config and fill in your values:

```bash
cd enabled/activate-sleep-mode
cp config.example.env config.env
# Edit config.env with your room names, speaker names, etc.
```

### 4. Run it

Tell your agent to follow the workflow:

```
Read and follow clawflows/enabled/activate-sleep-mode/WORKFLOW.md
```

Or schedule it with a cron:

```bash
openclaw cron create \
  --name "Sleep Mode" \
  --schedule "20 21 * * *" \
  --tz "America/New_York" \
  --message "Read and follow clawflows/enabled/activate-sleep-mode/WORKFLOW.md"
```

## CLI Reference

The `clawflows` CLI manages your enabled workflows and keeps your agent's `AGENTS.md` in sync.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `clawflows list` | Show all available workflows with enabled/disabled status |
| `clawflows enable <name>` | Copy workflow from `available/` to `enabled/`, update AGENTS.md |
| `clawflows disable <name>` | Remove workflow from `enabled/`, update AGENTS.md |
| `clawflows sync` | Regenerate the ClawFlows section in AGENTS.md from current `enabled/` |

### AGENTS.md Integration

When you enable or disable a workflow, `clawflows` automatically maintains a section in `AGENTS.md` (between `<!-- clawflows:start -->` and `<!-- clawflows:end -->` markers) with:

- Instructions for managing workflows
- A catalog of all enabled workflows with descriptions and paths

This gives your agent full discovery of available workflows at startup with zero manual maintenance. The agent reads AGENTS.md on every session and knows exactly which workflows are enabled and where to find them.

Set `AGENTS_MD` to override the default path (`~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md`).
